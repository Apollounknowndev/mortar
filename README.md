**Mortar** is a mod that aims to add missing stair, slab, and wall variants for various blocks in the game.

## Description

There are several block sets in the game that are missing slabs, stairs, and/or walls. This mod aims to remedy this, while not adding *so* many blocks that it feels overwhelming or out of place. On top of adding these missing variants, Tuff and Calcite get polished variants as well.

Big thanks to Oranamous who made the textures for this mod!
